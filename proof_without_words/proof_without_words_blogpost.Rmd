I recently watched the 2 part workshop ([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h29g21z0a68), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m4yywqNPVY)) on ggplot2 and extensions given by [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://www.data-imaginist.com/about). First of, it was really nice of Thomas to give the close to 4 hour workshop for the benefit of the community. I personally learnt a lot from it. I wanted to try out [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/index.html) extension that was covered during the workshop. 

There are several resources on the web that show animations/illustrations of proofs of mathematical identities and theorems without words (or close to it). I wanted to take a few of those examples and use gganimate to recreate the illustration. While this exercise may not qualify anywhere close to "useful" or "productive", it was definitely a super "fun" way for me to try out gganimate.

## Example 1:

This example is taken from [AoPS Online](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Proofs_without_words) and the result is that sum of first $n$ odd numbers equals $n^2$.
$$ 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n - 1) = n^2 $$
The animated version of the proof is show below 
([R code](https://github.com/notesofdabbler/learn_gganimate/blob/master/proof_without_words/sum_of_odds.R),

## Example 2:

This example is also taken from [AoPS Online](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Proofs_without_words) and the result is:

$$ 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + (n-1)^3 + n^3 = (1 + 2 + \ldots + n)^2 $$
The animated version of the proof is shown below (
[R code](https://github.com/notesofdabbler/learn_gganimate/blob/master/proof_without_words/sum_of_cubes.R),
[html file](https://github.com/notesofdabbler/learn_gganimate/blob/master/proof_without_words/sum_of_cubes.html)):

## Example 3

This example from [AoPS Online](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Proofs_without_words) illustrates the result

$$ \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2^4} + \frac{1}{2^6} + \frac{1}{2^8} + \ldots = \frac{1}{3} $$
The animated version of the proof is shown below (
[R code](https://github.com/notesofdabbler/learn_gganimate/blob/master/proof_without_words/infinite_series_1.R),
[html file](https://github.com/notesofdabbler/learn_gganimate/blob/master/proof_without_words/infinite_series_1.html)):

## Example 4

According to Pythagoras theorem, $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$
where $a$, $b$, $c$ are sides of a right angled triangle (with $c$ being the side opposite $90^o$ angle)

There was an illustration of the proof of pythogoras theorem in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2K11eFepcs) from [echalk](http://www.eChalk.co.uk).

The animated version of the proof is shown below (
[R code](https://github.com/notesofdabbler/learn_gganimate/blob/master/proof_without_words/pythagoras_theorem.R),
[html file](https://github.com/notesofdabbler/learn_gganimate/blob/master/proof_without_words/pythagoras_theorem.html))

In summary, it was great to use gganimate for these animations since it does all the magic with making transitions work nicely.
